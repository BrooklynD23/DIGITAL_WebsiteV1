# TODO — DIGITAL @ Cal Poly Pomona — Living Work Log

This file is the **authoritative work log** for the DIGITAL website project. It is organized
by Sprint. Each sprint contains a numbered task checklist and a Dev Build / Version Control
table that maps internal build numbers to git commit SHAs. Update this file whenever work is
committed — see the standing rule in `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENT.md`.

## Backlog / Blocked (needs org input)

- **Custom domain** — awaiting DNS credentials / domain decision from club leadership.
- **Real Formspree endpoint** — contact form is using a placeholder; needs the club's
  verified Formspree form ID.
- **Org logo + favicon / OG image** — final asset files needed from the design lead.
- **Heads-up Display Glasses copy** — project description, team lead, and timeline TBD;
  placeholder reads "More info soon" until the team provides details.
